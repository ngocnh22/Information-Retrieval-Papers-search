# Information Retrieval System for Research Papers


## Project Overview

This project aims to create an Information Retrieval (IR) system designed to search and retrieve research papers. The system allows users to query specific papers either from external databases or a local repository on your platform. The goal is to facilitate easier access to relevant research papers, making the process of gathering information more efficient for researchers and practitioners.
